        Drawlab is a fairly minimal digital painting app that I made in p5.js to explore some interactions for a more direct process. A drawing tablet or mobile stylus is recommended. Colors are chosen in the okhsl color space, which distributes colors more evenly according to human perception. Properties like the color, hue noise or brush size can be modified right on canvas at the location of the pen by tapping once and then dragging on one of the icons in the radial 'clover' menu. The app is still in development, and I am planning to add more features and improve the performance. I tried making a webgl iteration, but it was actually hard to make it any faster than the canvas version. Might resume that again somewhat soon.

        This app is inspired by Heavypaint, an initially super minimal painting app created by <code>Heavypoly</code> that finally got me into digital drawing. Fun fact: an earlier version of drawlab in turn inspired Heavypoly to try out a web version of Heavypaint, which has since become the new standard version of the app and has been ported back to mobile as well. Check it out at <a href="https://www.heavypaint.com">heavypaint.com</a>.

        Bendboard is a shader-based algorithmic microtonal fretboard/ keyboard intended for multitouch, like a tablet or phone. It is a tool for exploring microtonal scales and tuning systems, and for playing music in them. You can find a menu by tapping the octave visualizer in the top left corner. There are currently a lot of hidden features, a better UX for them will take some time to develop.

        Scales can be entered as a chord of overtones. For example, a typical major 7th chord could be expressed as the harmonics 1, 3, 5 and 15 when each is folded back down into the octave. This is written as <code>1:3:5:15</code>. Similarly, the scale <code>4:5:6:7</code> stands for the just ratios 4/4 (the unison), 5/4, 6/4 (also written as 3/2, the perfect fifth) and 7/4 (a minor seventh). To just play around with different equal temperaments, you can change the number of equal divisions of the octave in the menu and type 'all' in the scale input field.

        The vertical axis smoothly corresponds to the pitch, while the different columns next to each other are offset by a specific interval, by default 200 cents. This makes the initial layout mirror that of a harpejji. Any layout will have vertical distances directly corresponding to the pitch, and be isomorphic, that is, the same pattern will always produce the same chord, just transposed, no matter where it is played. A midi keyboard can be connected to use the app as a visualizer. I don't exactly recommend it for serious live playing, but it could be a fun tool for exploring new scales and tuning systems.
