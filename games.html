        I made some puzzle games, generally inspired by Sokoban. You can play them on <a href="https://cubestudio.itch.io/">itch.io</a>.
        <br>
        The games currently published feature a single level each and require rule discovery. They were made using PuzzleScript and run in the browser. I would recommend the latest one, <a href="https://cubestudio.itch.io/calendar-2023">></a>.

        I spent a while working on an unreleased game that is more complex and might be developed in some other engine or language. For now, I recommend the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295320/Can_of_Wormholes/">Can of Wormholes (Steam)</a>, made by munted finger. It is a puzzle game that released in the meantime with a similar concept to the one I was working on and is just brilliant!
