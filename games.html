        I made some puzzle games, generally inspired by Sokoban. The games currently published feature a single level each and require rule discovery. They were made using PuzzleScript and run in the browser. I would recommend the latest one, simply called <a href="https://cubestudio.itch.io/calendar-2023">">"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I spent a while working on an unreleased game that is more complex and might be developed in some other engine or language. For now, I recommend the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295320/Can_of_Wormholes/">Can of Wormholes (Steam)</a>, made by <code>munted finger</code>. It is a puzzle game that released in the meantime with a similar concept to the one I was working on and is just brilliant!

    <p>
        Make10! is my only game that is not a puzzle game - I used matter.js, but no game engine. It was inspired by all sorts of fan versions of Suika Game, itself very similar to a chinese game which is in turn similar to 2048 ... which is similar to Threes. It's pretty addictive for a while and should work well on mobile, although power saving modes might lower the framerate and make gravity slower. Drop spheres of the same value on each other and they merge into a bigger one with the next value. The goal is to reach 10. You can also try to get a  high score. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the original Suika Game, 3 of the same value can merge and skip a value, which removes some ambiguous situations and is pretty satisfying. Also, new spheres are shown above the board in a stack, rather than in an independent preview window. Bigger spheres are more valuable, but will then make less of the future spheres known. I also tweaked the physics a bit. Known issue: when four spheres are merged, the new sphere will not be visible. I might return to working on the game when I have a good idea how it could continue after there is no room for a second 10.
