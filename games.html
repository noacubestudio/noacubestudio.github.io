            I made a few rule-discovery puzzle games using Puzzlescript. Two of the games currently published only feature a single level each. I would recommend the newer one, simply called <a class="a-li" href="https://cubestudio.itch.io/calendar-2023">></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other tilebased block-pushing game on my itch.io is much bigger. It has about 60 levels and took three years to make and I am quite proud of it. It might take some people around three hours and has a variety of game mechanic reveals in store despite the minimal approach. <a href="https://cubestudio.itch.io/nuworm">nuworm</a> is also playable for free in the browser. I plan to write more about it in the future!

            I also recommend the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295320/Can_of_Wormholes/">Can of Wormholes (Steam)</a>, made by <code>munted finger</code>. It is a puzzle game that released as I was working on nuworm, features a similar concept and is just brilliant! Or have a look at the much more recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">Öoo (Steam)</a> by <code>Nama Takahashi</code> which has a vaguely similar setting, a connected map I wish I got to implement, and a much more gentle approach to difficulty.

        <h2>Make10!</h2>

            Make10! is my only game that is not a puzzle game - I used matter.js, but no game engine. It was inspired by all sorts of fan versions of Suika Game, itself very similar to a chinese game which is in turn similar to 2048 ... which is similar to Threes. It's pretty addictive for a while and should work well on mobile, although power saving modes might lower the framerate and make gravity slower. Drop spheres of the same value on each other and they merge into a bigger one with the next value. The goal is to reach 10. You can also try to get a  high score. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike the original Suika Game, 3 of the same value can merge and skip a value, which removes some ambiguous situations and is pretty satisfying. Also, new spheres are shown above the board in a stack, rather than in an independent preview window. Bigger spheres are more valuable, but will then make less of the future spheres known. I also tweaked the physics a bit. Known issue: when four spheres are merged, the new sphere will not be visible. I might return to working on the game when I have a good idea how it could continue after there is no room for a second 10.
