        I started this website a few days ago after not having a 'proper' site for years, only unfinished attempts using all sorts of frameworks or website builders. This time, it's just basic HTML and CSS! I'll be writing about what I work on this december in the spirit of the <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December Adventure</a>. <code>"The December Adventure is low key. The goal is to write a little bit of code every day in December."</code> ... I lacked motivation the first few days, so this won't be super strict. I'll try to write about what I do, though. Also need to mention <code>Lu Wilson's</code> encouraging mantra "Normalize sharing scrappy fiddles", see also their wonderful talk  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o">"What it means to be open"</a> recorded at Heart of Clojure 2024.

        Did not touch any code at all, but read a bunch about ADHD. Also did a big of practice on my recently modified keyboard layout, which switched to a different default keymap called Enthium (<a href="http://https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps/releases/v39">Glove80 Keymap by Sunaku</a>). Also spent a moment looking at some projects that inspired me a few years ago, but I now believe don't actually go as far as I thought then. They are concepts for a new kind of operating system but resemble macOS/ iOS a lot. One is <a href="https://desktopneo.com/">Desktop Neo</a> <code>by Lennart Ziburski, 2016</code>, and the other <a href="http://mercuryos.com">Mercury OS</a> <code>by Jason Yuan, 2019</code>. Still some interesting ideas in there that I admittedly can't really put into words too well.

        Did not get much done today. Was trying side by side display of images, er, SVGs when there is enough space. Also added the first bit of JS which is for a canvas in the background I could use for cool visuals. But then I found most of those rather distracting. I ended up putting in a simple feature where dragging on the canvas draws a low opacity line behind everything. It might be nice to embed the generative type projects maybe as iframes, in an interactive or at the very least animated way. This website aside, I did an ADHD test - more on that in half a year or a year perhaps...

        More website changes! Links now look a bit like buttons, I found the underline a bit noisy. I also use <code>code</code> in more places, for emphasis of names and next to "buttons" as additional "UI" showing metadata-ish information like the starting date of a project. The code and link CSS uses the default monospace, which might end up looking too different size wise. Is it a thing to size fonts on the web so their x-height match?

        My logo is based on the same initial idea the Multiline type generator is. It ends up featuring spiral-like shapes, which I quite like. So I found one to use as a glyph in my About text in place of an <code>@</code>. It looks like this: <code>꩜</code>! It comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_script">Cham Script</a> and is punctuation that "marks the beginning of a section." Pretty fitting!
    </p>

        Lastly, I also added another game to the <a href="games.html">games</a> page. It is not on itch.io but directly has its' own page. It was a pretty quick project from last year that some people I know actually ended up playing a lot. Making something other than a puzzle game was pretty interesting, it felt fun to play pretty much right away without having to be as intentional. Ultimately I prefer making puzzle games, though, perhaps for that exact reason. I wanted to expand the idea with powerups or something, but felt unsure what would feel elegant and not be too much work to prototype.

        Made some bigger changes to this website! I ... increased the number of pages from just one. Instead of linking to my interactive sites directly, I now write a bit about the various projects. I don't feel that good about the writing, but it will improve over time. There's a bit of an 'about' text introducing the various kinds of work I do, but I'm wondering if I should go even more casual and maybe make it not just about the projects I work on?

        One thing fairly obviously absent now is more images or other media. A page about art and music tools should probably feature some... art and music examples. I don't want to extensively document the tools yet since everything is subject to change, and I wonder about uploading lots of images to github. I should maybe be using some other service?
