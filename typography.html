    <h2>
        Generating glyphs
    </h2>
    <p>
        I like making modular and geometric typography and just draw glyphs in general. Particularly grid-based systems can be played with quickly, either by hand or with code. While there are many interesting approaches to generative typography out there, they often distort existing vector outlines rather than assemble letters from predesigned modules and purely generative elements. So I made some! You can try these in the browser, ideally on a desktop computer.

        Spine Sans is a system of modular fonts that are generated by combining two different sets of glyphs drawn in vector software with elements that are entirely generated from Code. Thanks to the regular column grid that glyphs are strictly placed on, all sorts of things can happen in between. I explored 3D and animated options, which are currently not in the interactive version. Currently, there is also no built in export, so downloading the results as images is the only way to save them.

        Multiline Maker is a tool for creating multiline text in p5.js. The letters are assembled from parameterized circle arcs and lines, which can be adjusted in the GUI, then downloaded in the SVG view. There are a few different base typefaces with the same parameters, and effects that would then inspire the design of the typeface family Spine Sans.
    </p>
    <p>
        The central idea and starting point is the horizontal offset parameter, which transforms concentric circles into spirals. A sketch from a few years prior was essentially just that effect applied to a word, now it is a tool for creating typefaces.
